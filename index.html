  <p> These are the projects I have made for our school events and even for my group project. The first image is the
    Eagle Mascot that we used during the Intrams last year. The second one is the flag that we used for the pageant
    during the Intrmas as well. Lastly, the drawing that I made for our Group Project in Earth and Life Science on our
    1st semester. </p>
